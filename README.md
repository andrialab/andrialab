## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the projects that I’ve worked on. Feel free to explore them and see what I've been up to!

### 1. **Bank Credit Risk Analysis: Probability of Default (PD) Model**
   - **Overview**: The goal of this project is to create a Probability of Default (PD) Model for banks and financial institutions. The model uses financial ratios and features derived from bank financial statements to predict whether a bank is likely to default within a specific time window. The analysis covers the entire process of data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using ROC AUC scores.

### 2. **Credit-Default-Simulation** 
   - **Overview**: Calculate default rates using historical data and incorporate previous work on class structures and time series to generate simulated historical defaults.

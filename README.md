## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the projects that I’ve worked on. Feel free to explore them and see what I've been up to!

### 1. **Bank Credit Risk Analysis**
   - **Overview**: The goal of this project is to create a Probability of Default (PD) Model for banks and financial institutions. The model uses financial ratios and features derived from bank financial statements to predict whether a bank is likely to default within a specific time window. The analysis covers the entire process of data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using ROC AUC scores.

### 2. **Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis - NYC** 
   - **Overview**: This project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City. It includes data preparation, cleaning, and visualization to identify trends and insights into crash incidents. The analysis covers key metrics such as injuries, fatalities, and vehicle involvement, leveraging Python and popular data science libraries.

### 3. **Individual Credit Default Simulation** 
   - **Overview**: Simulating the probability of default (PD) for borrowers over time using a stochastic process influenced by macro conditions, specifically unemployment rates.
